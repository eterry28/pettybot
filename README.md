# PettyBot 💅

A playful roast bot for Bluesky with the legendary energy of Don Rickles meets Eddie Murphy. Tag it for witty roasts at three spice levels.

## 🎤 What is PettyBot?

PettyBot delivers custom roasts to your Bluesky posts with animated, expressive humor. It's opt-in only, always playful (never cruel), and requires users to follow before getting roasted.

**Three Spice Levels:**
- 💚 **Mild** - Affectionate ribbing, like your funny uncle at a BBQ
- 💛 **Medium** - Classic comedy roast energy with animated disbelief
- 🌶️ **Spicy** - Full legendary roast mode, no holds barred (but still playful!)

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 Powered by Claude 3.5 Haiku for dynamic, unique responses
- 💙 Playful comedy, never cruel
- 🔒 Follower-gated (saves API costs + builds community)
- ✅ Roasts parent posts when you reply with a mention
- 🛡️ Built-in safety filters for sensitive topics
- ⚡ Real-time responses (checks mentions every 30 seconds)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Follow** @pettybot.bsky.social
2. **Tag** the bot on any post (yours or reply to someone else's)
3. **Choose** your spice level:
   - `@pettybot mild` - Gentle teasing
   - `@pettybot` or `@pettybot medium` - Balanced pettiness
   - `@pettybot spicy` - Maximum heat

**Example:**
```
User's Post: "Just meal prepped for the week!"
Your Reply: "@pettybot medium"
Bot's Response: "Wait wait wait - you did basic meal prep? Stop the presses! 
Nobody else has Tupperware!"
```

## 🔒 Safety & Rules

PettyBot will **NOT** roast:
- Physical appearance or weight
- Race, religion, or sexual orientation
- Mental health or trauma
- Disabilities or medical conditions
- Any sensitive personal topics

If sensitive content is detected, the bot responds:
> "We're sitting this one out 💙"

**Follower requirement:** Users must follow the bot before getting roasted. Non-followers get:
> "The audacity to want a roast without even following me. Follow first, then we'll talk 💅"

## 🎭 Voice & Style

PettyBot channels **Don Rickles + Eddie Murphy** energy:

**Mild**: Warm, affectionate ribbing
- "Look at you, acting like you invented Tupperware..."

**Medium**: Animated comedy roast
- "Oh NOW you wanna be different? That's what we're doing? Okay, okay."

**Spicy**: Full legendary roast mode
- "THREE DAYS! You did it for three days and came running to tell us like you climbed Everest!"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Bot not responding?**
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure bot account exists and credentials are valid
- Wait the full 30 seconds (polling interval)

**Testing locally:**
- Run `npm start`
- Tag the bot from your personal Bluesky account
- Watch console logs for activity

**Want faster local testing?**
Change polling interval in `index.js`:
```javascript
// Line ~180
setInterval(checkMentions, 10000); // 10 seconds instead of 30
```

## 📊 Monitoring

Watch Railway logs to see:
- Mentions detected
- Follower checks
- Responses generated
- Any errors

Example log output:
```
New mention from @username.bsky.social replying to: "I love pineapple on pizza"
Spice level: medium
Posted reply: Oh you like pineapple on pizza? How brave. Starting food discourse in 2025.
```
